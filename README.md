## Good code, man ðŸ‘‹
I am a programmer with a small but interesting experience working with the JavaScript language. Honestly, I don't consider myself a programmer, because I don't write complex programs that do complex calculations... The word coder is more appropriate ðŸ˜‡

ðŸ§  I am good friends with Node.js, I can build executable applications and have worked with various libraries.

âœ… I would like GTA 7 to be written in JavaScript. Will the whole community strive to make this happen? (this is a joke)
